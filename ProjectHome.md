ExifLibrary is a .NET library for extracting/editing metadata contained in JPEG/Exif files.

ExifLibrary is currently at planning/pre-alpha stage. The current pre-alpha release can extract and edit public Exif tags in JPEG/Exif files. Plug-ins for editing vendor specific metadata (the so called MakerNote) are currently being developed.

ExifLibrary requires the .NET framework 2.0.
