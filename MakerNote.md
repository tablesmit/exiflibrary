The APP1 section of a JPEG/Exif file contains a tag called the MakerNote which is used by camera vendors to record custom information. For example, lens type is typically written in the MakerNote since there is no public Exif tag defined for that purpose.

ExifLibrary will support editing of the MakerNote metadata through plug-ins written for specific manufacturer formats.
